Etch-A-Sketch
Eric Kirby

The Etch-A-Sketch code is a simple program meant to replicate the classic Etch-A-Sketch.

To run the program first give permissions to ./install.sh using chmod +x install.sh
Then run install.sh using ./install.sh
Finally run the Etch-A-Sketch program using ./etchASketch.py

You are able to set the number of spaces in both the x and y directions.
It will prompt you for inputs when run. Type in the desired number and hit enter.

Then you can move around and clear the screen just like in classic Etch-A-Sketch.
To move, use the arrow keys.
To clear the screen, use the spacebar.
